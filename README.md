# Master_project_work_showcase
 This repo is a small show case of my master project work using R and MATLAB. The most exciting part of this project that I want to discuss is data visualisation techinique I used. In this post, I will first introduce the background of this study, and then mainly discuss the results of my modelling and calculation work.
 
 


### Background information
Global warming is a well-sound alaram occupying the news everyday, before the corona hit us. The most relatable source of pollution or contribution for an average joe might be the black smoke comming out of the chimmney from nearby power plant. Indeed, coal-fired power plant is one of the main contributor to emissino of green house gases, but what is little know to many people is, it's not only green house gases being emited by power plant. Sometimes it also contains heavy metal pollutants,for example, mercury. 

But from all the emssion happend from global power plants, how much mercury emission happened every year? After they are emitted, how would they distribute globally? While, if it's really bad, what can we do to reduce it? How well the effect of reduction be? 

There has been some studies investigating in this question, but it's still rather new. My thesis project was then focusing on answering those quesitons by 1) modelling the mercury emission 2) Calculating the mercury gaseous concentration distribution globally, 3) Purpose the mitigation strategy and
